# VAD Module Validation Guide

## 1. Comparing Local VAD with OpenAI VAD
- Run both VAD systems in parallel (if OpenAI VAD is still available).
- Log or print both VAD event streams (speech started/stopped) for the same audio input.
- Compare:
  - Detection timing (start/stop)
  - False positives/negatives
  - Latency
- Use the test script (`scripts/test_silero_vad.py`) to generate controlled audio samples and compare outputs.

## 2. Testing with Different Speakers, Environments, and Formats
- **Speakers**: Test with multiple people (different genders, accents, speaking styles).
- **Environments**: Test in quiet, noisy, and echoic rooms.
- **Audio Formats**: Test with 8kHz and 16kHz, 16-bit PCM, and Î¼-law if supported.
- Use the test script to record and analyze results for each scenario.

## 3. Interpreting Results
- **Speech Percentage**: Aim for 30-70% speech detection in typical conversation.
- **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust `VAD_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` for best balance between sensitivity and specificity.
- **Event Consistency**: Speech start/stop events should align with actual speech boundaries.
- **Latency**: Lower is better; measure time from speech onset to event emission.
- **Robustness**: VAD should not trigger on background noise or silence.

## 4. Troubleshooting
- If VAD is too sensitive, increase the threshold.
- If VAD misses speech, lower the threshold.
- For format issues, ensure audio is properly converted to float32 mono.

## 5. Tools
- Use `scripts/test_silero_vad.py` for local, interactive validation and visualization.
- Use logs and event traces for deeper analysis.
