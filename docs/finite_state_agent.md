# Finite State Agents (FSA)

*This is a future feature, not implemented yet

## Overview

Finite State Agents (FSA) represent an extension of traditional Finite State Machines (FSMs) designed specifically for conversational AI agents. FSA provide structured, controllable, and dynamic conversational flows while maintaining the intelligence and flexibility of modern language models.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Traditional FSMs vs. FSA

Traditional Finite State Machines consist of:
- A finite set of states
- A set of transitions between states
- A defined initial state
- A set of final states

Finite State Agents extend this model by:
- Embedding agent reasoning capabilities within each state
- Introducing dynamic state evaluation based on context
- Maintaining memory and context across state transitions
- Supporting hybrid deterministic/probabilistic transitions

### Core Components

1. **States**
   - Each state represents a distinct conversational context or intent
   - States contain embedded reasoning logic and response generation capabilities
   - States define how context is processed and what output is generated

2. **Transitions**
   - Rules governing movement between states
   - Can be triggered by explicit user intents or implicit conversational cues
   - May contain pre-conditions and post-conditions

3. **Scratchpads**
   - Temporary reasoning spaces within each state
   - Allow agents to "think" without affecting the final output
   - Support step-by-step reasoning for complex decisions

4. **Context Management**
   - Salient context persists across state transitions
   - Historical memory can be selectively maintained or discarded
   - Context prioritization based on relevance to current state

## Implementation Architecture

### State Definition

```python
class FSAState:
    def __init__(self, name, description, allowed_transitions=None):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.allowed_transitions = allowed_transitions or []
        self.scratchpad = ""
    
    async def process(self, input_text, context):
        # Process input in the context of this state
        # Update scratchpad with reasoning
        # Return response and potential state transitions
        pass
```

### Transition Logic

Transitions can be:
1. **Rule-based**: Deterministic transitions based on explicit conditions
2. **Intent-based**: Driven by NLU-detected user intents
3. **Reasoning-based**: Determined by agent reasoning in scratchpads
4. **Hybrid**: Combining multiple transition strategies

### Context Management

Every FSA maintains:
- **Current State**: The active conversational context
- **Salient Context**: Key information relevant to the conversation
- **Scratchpad Content**: Current reasoning process
- **Memory**: Persistent information across the session

## Advantages for Conversational Agents

1. **Predictability with Flexibility**
   - Maintains control over conversational flow while allowing for dynamic responses
   - Prevents hallucinations and out-of-scope responses

2. **Transparent Reasoning**
   - Scratchpads expose agent thought processes
   - Makes agent decisions auditable and debuggable

3. **Optimized Performance**
   - State-specific prompting reduces token usage
   - Focused reasoning within defined contexts

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - Limits potential attack vectors through state constraints
   - Prevents prompt injection by validating transitions

## Practical Applications

### Customer Service

```
[Greeting State] → [Problem Identification] → [Solution Proposal] → [Verification] → [Resolution]
```

Each state contains specific reasoning appropriate to its function, with transitions governed by customer responses and problem complexity.

### Healthcare Triage

```
[Initial Assessment] → [Symptom Collection] → [Risk Evaluation] → [Recommendation] → [Follow-up Scheduling]
```

Strict transition rules ensure proper protocol adherence while maintaining conversational fluidity.

### Banking Transactions

```
[Authentication] → [Intent Recognition] → [Transaction Processing] → [Confirmation] → [Completion]
```

Security constraints embedded in transition conditions prevent unauthorized operations.

## Best Practices

1. **Design Clear States**
   - Each state should have a singular, well-defined purpose
   - State descriptions should guide agent reasoning appropriately

2. **Limit State Proliferation**
   - Too many states increase complexity
   - Consider hierarchical state structures for complex flows

3. **Balance Control and Flexibility**
   - Overly restrictive transitions limit agent capabilities
   - Too much freedom risks unpredictable behavior

4. **Optimize Context Management**
   - Only maintain relevant context across states
   - Clear irrelevant information to prevent context contamination

5. **Monitor and Analyze**
   - Log state transitions and scratchpad content
   - Use analytics to refine state definitions and transitions

## Conclusion

Finite State Agents provide a powerful framework for building conversational agents that combine the structured control of traditional systems with the intelligence of modern language models. By embedding reasoning capabilities within a finite state structure, FSA enable predictable, transparent, and efficient agent behaviors while maintaining the dynamic responsiveness users expect from AI-powered conversation.
