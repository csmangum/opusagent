## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Test your setup:**
```bash
python test_tui_setup.py
```

3. **Start TelephonyRealtimeBridge:**
```bash
python run_opus_server.py
```

4. **Launch Enhanced TUI:**
```bash
python -m tui.main
```

5. **Start testing:**
- Press `c` to connect
- Press `s` to start session  
- Press `1-4` or click buttons to send phrases
- Listen to bot responses through speakers
- Monitor function calls and state changes

## 🎛️ New Components

### **SoundboardPanel**
- Located in `tui/components/soundboard_panel.py`
- 3x4 grid of phrase buttons
- Audio file selector
- Real-time status display
- Integrated with session state

### **Enhanced AudioPanel**
- Auto-initializes playback system
- Handles bot audio chunks for live playback
- Enhanced visualization and status

### **Updated Main TUI**
- Integrated soundboard into layout
- Added keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced help system
- Better component coordination

## 🎵 Soundboard Configuration

### Pre-configured Phrases:
```python
{
    "Hello": "Hello, how are you doing today?",
    "Bank Info": "Can you tell me about your bank services?", 
    "Card Lost": "I need to report a lost credit card",
    "Balance": "What is my account balance?",
    "Transfer": "I want to transfer money to another account",
    "Loan": "I'm interested in applying for a loan",
    # ... and 6 more
}
```

### Audio File Locations:
- `static/` - Primary audio file directory
- `test_audio/` - Additional audio files
- `audio_samples/` - Sample files

### Supported Formats:
- **WAV** (recommended - best quality)
- **MP3/FLAC** (with librosa)
- **16kHz PCM** for optimal compatibility

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Audio Pipeline:**
```
Soundboard → AudioUtils → Base64 → WebSocket → TelephonyBridge → OpenAI
Bot Response ← Speakers ← AudioManager ← WebSocket ← TelephonyBridge ← OpenAI
```

### **State Management:**
- Session state tracked across all components
- Connection status propagated to soundboard
- Audio system status monitored
- Function calls logged and displayed

### **Message Flow:**
```
1. User clicks soundboard button
2. Audio file loaded and chunked
3. userStream.start sent
4. Audio chunks streamed via userStream.chunk
5. userStream.stop sent
6. Bot processes and responds
7. playStream events received
8. Audio played through speakers
9. Function calls displayed in transcript
```

## 🎯 Perfect for Your Use Case

This implementation gives you exactly what you wanted:

✅ **WebSocket connection** to your endpoint
✅ **Session management** with visual feedback
✅ **Soundboard** for rapid phrase testing
✅ **Live audio playback** of bot responses  
✅ **Function call monitoring** in real-time
✅ **Call state visualization** throughout

## 📞 Typical Test Workflow
