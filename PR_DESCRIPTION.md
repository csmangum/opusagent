# Agent Encapsulation Framework - Improved Modularity and Dependency Injection

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive agent encapsulation framework that addresses the architectural limitations identified in the current OpusAgent codebase. The new framework introduces dependency injection patterns, factory methods, and configuration-driven agent creation to improve modularity, testability, and maintainability.

## Problem Statement

The current architecture has several issues:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Bridges are hardcoded to specific agent implementations through direct imports
2. **Manual Wiring**: Function registration requires scattered manual calls throughout the codebase
3. **Limited Flexibility**: Difficult to swap agent implementations without code changes
4. **Testing Challenges**: Hard to mock or substitute agents for testing
5. **Inconsistent Interfaces**: Different agent types have different APIs and registration patterns

### Current Problematic Pattern
```python
# In base_bridge.py - HARDCODED!
from opusagent.customer_service_agent import register_customer_service_functions
register_customer_service_functions(self.function_handler)
```

## Solution: Agent Encapsulation Framework

### Key Components

#### 1. **BaseAgent Interface** (`opusagent/agents/base_agent.py`)
- Unified abstract base class that all agents must implement
- Consistent interface for session configuration, function registration, and metadata
- Eliminates API inconsistencies between different agent types

```python
@abstractmethod
def get_session_config(self) -> SessionConfig:
    """Return OpenAI session configuration"""
    
@abstractmethod
def register_functions(self, function_handler) -> None:
    """Register agent-specific functions"""
    
@abstractmethod  
def get_agent_info(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Return agent metadata and capabilities"""
```

#### 2. **Agent Registry** (`opusagent/agents/agent_registry.py`)
- Central registry for agent discovery and instantiation
- Supports both class-based and factory-based registration
- Enables dynamic agent creation by type identifier

```python
# Registration
@register_agent("customer_service")
class CustomerServiceAgent(BaseAgent):
    pass

# Creation
agent = AgentRegistry.create_agent("customer_service", specialization="banking")
```

#### 3. **Agent Factories** (`opusagent/agents/agent_factory.py`)
- Factory classes for different agent categories
- Configuration-driven agent creation
- Support for specialized agent variants

```python
# Factory usage
banking_agent = CustomerServiceAgentFactory.create_banking_agent()
frustrated_caller = CallerAgentFactory.create_frustrated_caller()

# Configuration-driven
config = {"type": "customer_service", "specialization": "healthcare"}
agent = AgentFactory.create_from_config(config)
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Bridge with Dependency Injection** (`opusagent/bridges/enhanced_base_bridge.py`)
- Accepts agents as constructor dependencies instead of hardcoding them
- Automatically uses agent's session configuration and function registration
- Enables runtime agent swapping

```python
# OLD WAY (coupled)
bridge = BaseRealtimeBridge(websocket, realtime_ws, session_config)

# NEW WAY (dependency injection)
agent = AgentFactory.create_banking_agent()
bridge = EnhancedBaseRealtimeBridge(websocket, realtime_ws, agent)
```

#### 5. **Configuration-Driven Agent Selection** (`config/agents.yaml`)
- YAML/JSON configuration for different agent types and environments
- Environment-specific overrides (dev, staging, production)
- Easy A/B testing and configuration deployment

```yaml
agents:
  customer_service:
    banking:
      type: "customer_service"
      specialization: "banking"
      voice: "verse"
      temperature: 0.7
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Refactored Agents

1. **CustomerServiceAgent** - Implements BaseAgent with specialization support
2. **CallerAgent** - Unified caller with configurable personalities and scenarios
3. Both agents self-contain their session configuration and function registration

### Factory Patterns

- `CustomerServiceAgentFactory` - Creates CS agents with different specializations
- `CallerAgentFactory` - Creates caller agents with different personalities
- `AgentFactory` - Generic factory with configuration support

### Configuration Support

- YAML/JSON configuration files for agent definitions
- Environment-specific overrides
- Runtime configuration loading

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Modularity**
- Agents are self-contained with clear interfaces
- Easy to add new agent types without modifying bridges
- Better separation of concerns

### 2. **Enhanced Testability**
- Mock agents can be easily injected for testing
- Isolated testing of individual components
- Better unit test coverage potential

### 3. **Configuration Flexibility**
- Agents can be selected through configuration
- Environment-specific agent deployments
- A/B testing different agent configurations

### 4. **Easier Development**
- Clear patterns for adding new agents
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Better code organization

### 5. **Production Benefits**
- Hot-swappable agent configurations
- Better monitoring and observability
- Easier troubleshooting and debugging

## Migration Path

### Backward Compatibility
- New framework implemented alongside existing code
- Existing APIs maintained during transition
- Gradual migration path for custom implementations

### Usage Examples

```python
# Creating agents with factories
cs_agent = CustomerServiceAgentFactory.create_banking_agent(
    name="Banking Specialist",
    voice="verse"
)

# Creating agents from configuration
config = {
    "type": "caller",
    "personality_type": "frustrated", 
    "scenario_type": "complaint"
}
caller = AgentFactory.create_from_config(config)

# Injecting into bridges (future enhancement)
bridge = EnhancedTwilioBridge(websocket, realtime_ws, cs_agent)

# Runtime agent swapping
bridge.swap_agent(banking_specialist)
```
