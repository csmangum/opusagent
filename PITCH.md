# OpusAgent ‚Äì An Experimental AI Telephony Framework

Imagine a framework where developers can prototype AI call centers in hours, not months. Where you can test complex conversation flows with AI callers before touching real customers. Where the line between experimentation and production is just a deployment script away. **OpusAgent** is exactly that: an open-source, experimental framework for building AI telephony systems that bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI research and real-world voice applications.

### **What is OpusAgent?**
OpusAgent is an experimental AI telephony framework built on FastAPI that connects telephony providers (AudioCodes, Twilio) to AI backends (OpenAI Realtime API). It's designed for developers and researchers who want to explore voice AI without the overhead of enterprise solutions. The framework combines real-time audio processing with conversational AI, offering both local and cloud-based transcription options.

### **Core Features: What's Actually Implemented**

#### **‚úÖ Real-Time Voice Processing**
- **Bidirectional Audio Streaming**: WebSocket-based audio handling with configurable sample rates
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Silero VAD integration for speech detection
- **Audio Format Support**: Œº-law/PCM conversions, resampling (8kHz to 24kHz)
- **Quality Monitoring**: Basic audio quality metrics (SNR, THD) in development

#### **‚úÖ AI Integration**
- **OpenAI Realtime API**: Full integration with streaming audio/text
- **Local Transcription**: PocketSphinx and Whisper backends for offline processing
- **Text-Only Mode**: Cost-effective option for testing without audio generation
- **Function Calling**: Basic function execution framework (some functions still need implementation)

#### **‚úÖ Telephony Bridges**
- **AudioCodes Bridge**: Full WebSocket integration with session management
- **Twilio Bridge**: Webhook and WebSocket support
- **Dual Agent Bridge**: AI-to-AI testing with simulated caller personalities
- **Mock Systems**: Comprehensive testing environment for development

#### **‚úÖ Session Management**
- **State Persistence**: Redis and memory storage options
- **Session Resumption**: Framework exists but SMS functionality is aspirational
- **Call Continuity**: Basic session recovery mechanisms

#### **‚úÖ Testing & Validation**
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 100+ tests covering core functionality
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated testing for bridges, VAD, transcription
